CRM 2/4/2016:
It seems like the code gets exponentially slower the more objects I add to
the scenario file. Is it feasible to combine scenarios into a single pool?

The ownership version of things seems to only produce one net?

Hypernyms are solving a problem that I agree exists (lack of generality of
entities), but I'm not certain it's the right solution. What if resource
pools were adjectives/properties, and we assigned said properties to
various nouns that could instantiate them? 

New ideas:

- Player/system assignment to transitions
- Reward/punishment system for constraining the system by mood/theme?
  E.g. "reward contemplation, punish haste." Do these make sense at the
  abstract level?

Possible complete overhauls:
- What if we went the other direction, concrete -> abstract? It seems like
  "value specifications" ("reward contemplation, punish haste") are going
  to manifest better as concrete mechanics. Abstracting after-the-fact
  probably still makes sense as a top-down check on the global sense-making
  of the game design?
