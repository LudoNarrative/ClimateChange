TODO
- Path needs to save which nodes satisfied choices, so the UI can display the correct choiceLabel in the menu.
- Factor Display out of StoryAssembler (shouldn't depend on it)
- Implement "order" and "mandatory" properties for wishlists.
- Handle choices where not all options can be satisfied: should it remove those options? crash b/c of bad authoring?
- ON-screen debugging showing current wishlist, possibly chunk library too.
- Horrifying inefficiency. [to do with BestPath recursion, specifically when looking for ids it shouldn't need to recurse through stuff, just stop.]


Future:

- Figure out a way to allow comments in data format. (i.e. not raw json)
- Basic editor for JSON
- What about chunks being reused
- ALlow commentsi n JSON
