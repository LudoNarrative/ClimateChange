CURRENT
- Handle choices where not all options can be satisfied: should it remove those options? crash b/c of bad authoring?


TODO
- Factor Display out of StoryAssembler (shouldn't depend on it)
- Implement "order" and "mandatory" properties for wishlists.
- ON-screen debugging showing current wishlist, possibly chunk library too.
- Test that if a chunk has "request" instead of content, displaying it will jump forward until it finds something with content.


Future:

- Figure out a way to allow comments in data format. (i.e. not raw json)
- Basic editor for JSON
- What about chunks being reused
- ALlow commentsi n JSON
- Research in unit tests: how to test properties of an object? If you check directly, it'll crash with a "cannot read property x of y." If you check that the object exists first, it just adds a failing test before the crash.
