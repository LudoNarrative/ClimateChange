TODO
- Factor Display out of StoryAssembler (shouldn't depend on it)
- Implement "order" and "mandatory" properties for wishlists.
- Handle choices where not all options can be satisfied: should it remove those options? crash b/c of bad authoring?
- Path needs to save which nodes satisfied choices, so the UI can display the correct choiceLabel in the menu.



Future:

- Figure out a way to allow comments in data format. (i.e. not raw json)
- Basic editor for JSON
