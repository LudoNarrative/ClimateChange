CURRENT
- Test that if a chunk has "request" instead of content, displaying it will jump forward until it finds something with content.


TODO
- Factor Display out of StoryAssembler (shouldn't depend on it)
- Implement "order" and "mandatory" properties for wishlists.
- Fix commented out choiceDetails printing (two places)
- Possible bug in the case where we're recursing to find a subgoal that's the same as one of our wishlist goals. [Think about what happens in this case.]

Future:

- Replace flat max_depth with a dynamic heuristic that stops searching any path that has gone more than N nodes without satisfying a Want from the wishlist. (Ben's idea.)
- Figure out a way to allow comments in data format. (i.e. not raw json)
- Basic editor for JSON
- What about chunks being reused
- ALlow commentsi n JSON
- Research in unit tests: how to test properties of an object? If you check directly, it'll crash with a "cannot read property x of y." If you check that the object exists first, it just adds a failing test before the crash.


Done:
- Implement a max_depth to speed up BestPath
- ON-screen debugging showing current wishlist, possibly chunk library too.
