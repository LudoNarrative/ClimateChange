        "What's the point?" Rodrigo muttered. "We're doing all this work, but will it even make a difference?"

        ways to structure
        one increasing optimism
        one decreasing optimism
        one dependant on facts

        condition: optimism > 5
          passionate - incr optimism, decr patience
          rude - decr optimism, decr patience
          gentle - incr optimism, incr patience
        condition: optimism < 5
          reluctant - incr optimism, incr patience
          passionate - decr optimism, decr patience
          disillusioned - decr optimism, decr patience
        facts!

        I don't know what to write i feel like the original was already perfect like what else could i add i mean how do i even start?

        perhaps

        What's the point, Rodrigo says, moving the crabs? the earth is still burning
        emma: passionately says that we're making a DIFFERENCE okay we're saving crabs
              rudely says that we wouldn't be doing this if it wasn't important
              gently says that the crabs will be safer on the other side of the bay

        emma: reluctantly says i guess you're right
              passionately says i know right?? will this really do something
              disillusionly says we need a distraction from the very fact.
                we'll keep doing things in order to avoid thinkiing about our impeding doom.

        perhaps first just have emma and rodrigo talk
