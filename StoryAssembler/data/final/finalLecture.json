//TODO: lectureContent3 shouldn't have two choices, it should have one choice that's dynamic

//TODO: currently lectureEndWell, lectureEndOK, and LectureEndBadly erroneously use "set followUp true" to ensure wishlist item is met if you don't followup with the student, but that is not technically correct. Needs to be re-worked
