You enjoy her passion, though she does tend to get some things wrong in her excitement. <br/><br/> Establish Franklin as an intelligent and eloquent student, though has a very snotty manner of asking questions that seem purposefully provocative and implying that global warming isn't real. He gets under your skin just a little, though you do enjoy the challenge of bringing some form of awareness to skeptical students. <br/><br/> Establish Jessie as a shy, soft-spoken student who hasn't raised their hand at all during class, but they clearly seem uncertain and nervous.",
