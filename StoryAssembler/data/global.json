		These are the global chunks that can be brought into any level

		Backstory: Fragments that can be seated with each character. Two types: Emma backstory that she might bring up at any point (that serves as exposition for her character) or general backstory from others about what it's like to live in a world with climate change

		Knowledge: These are nuggets of knowledge that can be inserted into lectures, arguments, etc.

		Challenge: Chunks that might turn up from students, dinner conversation, or workers saying that climate change isn't real.

		Support: Positive chunks saying we can make a difference.
