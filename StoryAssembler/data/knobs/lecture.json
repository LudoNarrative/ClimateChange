//TODO: lectureContent3 shouldn't have two choices, it should have one choice that's dynamic, driven by global_classStyle
//TODO: switch all "set lecture true" and "set seminar true" to use global_classStyle, and 

//TODO: currently lectureEndWell, lectureEndOK, and LectureEndBadly erroneously use "set followUp true" to ensure wishlist item is met if you don't followup with the student, but that is not technically correct. Needs to be re-worked
/*

Todo:
-come up with three different areas lecture can be about
-come up with three canonical specialties for Emma
-demonstrate nerves of steel
    -maybe your cell phone / some loud noise happens and you overreact
    -drop your books / materials and freak out
-come up with more optimistic content
-come up wiht more antagonistic content
-insert a mention of climateseverity (maybe mention curve..."we're on track for real problems")
    -1-4: mention of drought (climate destroyed habitats / extinct? / toxic algae blooms (means no crab/lobster season))
    -5-7: mandated hurricane season closure for campus flooding
    -8-10: recently re-located students from Florida evacuations
