StoryAssembler

StoryAssembler is a generator for interactive choice-based stories designed to flexibly respond to a game state.

TO RUN

Because StoryAssembler needs to load data from text files, it needs to be served by a web server. If running from within the ClimateGame distribution, you can use the "start" shell script in the root of that folder to start a twistd server, then navigate in your browser to:

	http://localhost:8000/StoryAssembler/
