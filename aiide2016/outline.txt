Working Title:
Operationalizing Procedural Reasoning

Scope:
Describe the work on the game generator side -- specifically, by
representing the arguments used in prior work to do "procedural readings"
as rules in ASP, and by representing facts about various games as base ASP
facts, we can automatically:
- Check whether a game matches a high-level design specification
- Generate high-level design knowledge from a game's mechanics and other
  characteristics
- Generate fully-specified games from high-level design specifications.

Novel contribution:
- Range of operational logics (not just 1)
- Automated game understanding, in general
- Theme, mood, and cultural context incorporated into generation and
  reasoning process
